Installing TgTools
***********************

As a standalone (executable) script
=======================================

This option does not require a Python environment set up.

#. Download one of the following zip files based on your OS:

   - Windows 64bit:
     `download link <https://github.com/DanielEphraty/tgtools/releases/download/v0.3.0/tgtools-x64-0.3.0.zip>`_

#. Extract the zip file to your local drive

As a Python script
========================

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install mh-tgtools

.. note::
   You might like to copy the files: *config.toml* and *network.txt*
   from the *Lib/site-packages/mh-tgtools* directory (in your Python environment) to
   your working directory - as templates, then edit them as required.
